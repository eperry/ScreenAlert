+# üõ°Ô∏è Antivirus False Positive Information
+
+## What Happened?
+Windows Defender (or other antivirus software) flagged ScreenAlert.exe as containing a threat. **This is a false positive** - the executable is completely safe.
+
+## Why Does This Happen?
+
+### Common Causes of False Positives:
+1. **PyInstaller Executables**: Apps built with PyInstaller often trigger AV warnings
+2. **Screen Capture Functionality**: Screenshot capabilities can seem suspicious to heuristic scanning
+3. **Automation Features**: Tools using PyAutoGUI for automation may be flagged
+4. **Unsigned Executables**: Without a code signing certificate, Windows treats it as potentially untrusted
+5. **Packed Dependencies**: All Python libraries bundled into one file can look like malware obfuscation
+
+## ‚úÖ How to Verify ScreenAlert is Safe
+
+### 1. Check the Source
+- **Full source code**: Available at https://github.com/eperry/ScreenAlert
+- **Build process**: All builds done via public GitHub Actions
+- **Open development**: Everything is transparent and auditable
+
+### 2. Verify File Integrity
+```powershell
+# Check the SHA256 hash matches:
+Get-FileHash ScreenAlert.exe -Algorithm SHA256
+# Should match: 749783A6D610EB81C533C1C1CE2A9138E60956A4A364FC93AF52D22B3BA3B753

+3. Click "Manage settings" under "Virus & threat protection settings"
+4. Scroll to "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions"
+5. Add the ScreenAlert.exe file or folder
