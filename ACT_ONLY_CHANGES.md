# ACT-Only Build Configuration - Change Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Build Script Protection (`build/build_nuitka.py`)
- Added `check_execution_environment()` function
- Blocks execution unless `ACT=true` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` environment variables are set
- Shows clear error message directing users to use `.\run-github-actions.ps1`
- Modified main execution to check environment first

### 2. PowerShell Script Redirects
- **`build-direct.ps1`**: Now shows error and redirects to ACT
- **`check-build.ps1`**: Now shows error and redirects to ACT
- Both scripts exit with error code 1 to prevent continuation

### 3. Documentation Updates
- **`BUILD.md`**: Complete rewrite explaining ACT-only building
- **`README.md`**: Added build section with ACT instructions
- Clear explanation of why direct Windows builds are disabled

### 4. Build Environment Enforcement
- Python build script only runs in ACT/CI environments
- PowerShell scripts redirect all direct build attempts
- Consistent error messages across all entry points

## Key Benefits

✅ **Consistency**: Same build environment across all platforms  
✅ **Reproducibility**: Containerized builds eliminate environment issues  
✅ **CI/CD Parity**: Local builds match exactly what runs in GitHub Actions  
✅ **Dependency Management**: No local Python/library conflicts  

## User Experience

### Before
```powershell
# Multiple build methods, potential inconsistencies
.\build-direct.ps1           # Direct Windows build
.\check-build.ps1           # Validated build
python build/build_nuitka.py # Manual build script
.\run-github-actions.ps1    # ACT build
```

### After
```powershell
# Single consistent build method
.\run-github-actions.ps1    # ✅ Only build method

# All others redirect with helpful error messages
.\build-direct.ps1          # ❌ Redirects to ACT
.\check-build.ps1          # ❌ Redirects to ACT  
python build/build_nuitka.py # ❌ Blocks execution
```

## Error Messages

All blocked methods show consistent messaging:
- Clear explanation that direct Windows builds are disabled
- Specific instruction to use `.\run-github-actions.ps1`
- Benefits of using ACT-based builds
- Professional error formatting

## Technical Implementation

### Environment Detection
```python
def check_execution_environment():
    if os.environ.get('ACT') == 'true':
        return True  # ACT environment
    if os.environ.get('GITHUB_ACTIONS') == 'true':
        return True  # GitHub Actions
    return False  # Block direct execution
```

### PowerShell Redirects
- Consistent error formatting with colored output
- Exit code 1 to prevent script continuation  
- Clear call-to-action directing to ACT

## Verification

All changes have been tested:
- ✅ `py build/build_nuitka.py` blocks with error message
- ✅ `.\build-direct.ps1` shows redirect message
- ✅ `.\check-build.ps1` shows redirect message  
- ✅ `.\run-github-actions.ps1` remains the only working build method

## Result

**Mission Accomplished**: Direct Windows builds are now completely disabled. All build operations must go through ACT (local GitHub Actions) ensuring consistent, reproducible builds across all environments.
