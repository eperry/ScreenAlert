## Alternative: Command Line with curl (Advanced)

If you want to use the GitHub API directly, you can create a release using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/eperry/ScreenAlert/releases \
  -d '{
    "tag_name": "v1.2",
    "target_commitish": "main", 
    "name": "ScreenAlert v1.2 - Enhanced UI and Automated Documentation",
    "body": "Release notes content here...",
    "draft": false,
    "prerelease": false
  }'
```

But the web interface is much easier!
