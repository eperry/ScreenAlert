# Alternatives to ACT for Local GitHub Actions Testing

## 1. **Self-Hosted Runners (Best Option)**
- **Pros**: Perfect parity, native Windows, real GitHub Actions
- **Cons**: Requires GitHub connection to trigger
- **Setup**: See `setup-self-hosted-runner.md`

## 2. **GitHub Codespaces**
- **Pros**: Cloud-based, Windows containers available
- **Cons**: Costs money, not truly local
- **Use Case**: When you want cloud-based local testing

## 3. **GitLab CI Local Runner**
- **Pros**: Can run GitLab CI/CD locally
- **Cons**: Doesn't support GitHub Actions syntax
- **Alternative**: Convert workflows to GitLab CI format

## 4. **Manual Local Scripts**
- **Pros**: Full Windows support, fast
- **Cons**: Manually maintain parity with workflows
- **Example**: Create PowerShell scripts that mirror workflow steps

## 5. **Docker Desktop with Windows Containers**
- **Pros**: Better Windows support than ACT
- **Cons**: Still containerized, complex setup
- **Note**: Windows containers are large and resource-heavy

## 6. **Azure DevOps Self-Hosted Agents**
- **Pros**: Similar concept to GitHub runners
- **Cons**: Different from GitHub Actions
- **Use Case**: If you're open to switching CI systems

## Recommendation: Self-Hosted Runner

For your ScreenAlert Windows application, the **self-hosted GitHub Actions runner** is the best choice because:

1. ✅ **Perfect compatibility** with your existing workflow
2. ✅ **Native Windows environment** for `pywin32` and GUI libraries  
3. ✅ **True local testing** with same results as GitHub
4. ✅ **Easy setup** - just one configuration step
5. ✅ **Free** - no additional costs beyond your local machine

The runner will execute your exact `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` file locally on your Windows machine, giving you the 1:1 parity you wanted with ACT, but actually working for Windows applications.
