In Beta Testing,

This is a tool for monitoring applications where you have to watch many different areas for changes on the screen. 

Monitoring systems, Websites, etc

In conformance with application best practices, this tool does nothing to automate or initiate any functionality. It only observes, logs and reports. 

## ðŸš€ Building ScreenAlert

ScreenAlert uses **ACT (local GitHub Actions)** for consistent, reproducible builds:

```powershell
.\run-github-actions.ps1
```

This runs the complete build process in a containerized environment. Direct Windows builds are disabled to ensure consistency across all platforms.

ðŸ“– See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed build instructions.
